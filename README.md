# Professional-Portfolio

Page is created to be a base for my professional portfolio.  Within this website you will find the following: 

1.  About me section
2.  My work section containing placeholder images for projects that I have done.  These images will expand in size when hovered over them to provide additional emphasis and style
3.  Clicking on the navigation links at the top of the screen will take you to their respective sections
4.  Changing of the screensize will present you with slightly different views of the page without needing to scroll based on screensize
